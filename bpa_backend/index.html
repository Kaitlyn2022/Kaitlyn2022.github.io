                    <p> Medina County uses Single Stream Recycling is a system in which all recyclables (paper, plastics, metals, etc.) are collected
                        and handled together, instead of being collected and handled separately. The entire process eliminates the need for people to separate their recyclable materials and place them in
                        separate bins for collection.</p>
                    <p>Residents of Medina County can bring mercury-containing items, including medical thermometers, mercury 
                        "switches, and liquid mercury for free collection. All unbroken mercury thermometers, and mercury containing devices <strong>MUST</strong> be sealed inside <strong>TWO</strong> zip-lock bags,
                        or a rigid, sealed container, such as a glass jar or plastic bottle prior to leaving your home. Mercury is a silvery liquid, most commonly found inside glass thermometers and thermostat switches.</p>
